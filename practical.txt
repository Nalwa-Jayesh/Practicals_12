The last time John visited, Jake had invented a game using glow in the dark balloon
He couldn't wait to play it again
Maybe the twins would join in
Jake put the clothes on his bed
He opened his underwear drawer, but it was already overflowing
Even if he folded each pair, there was no chance that the fresh laundary would fit in
That's weird, he thought
Since when did jacks multiply ?
